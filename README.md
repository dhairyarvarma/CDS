C++ Data Structures Semester3
EXPERIMENT 1
Hello World and Calculator program

Aim: The aim of this experiment is to study and implement the basic structure of a C++ program, focusing on understanding the different data types available. This includes writing and executing simple programs such as printing "Hello World" and creating a basic calculator to perform arithmetic operations.

Procedure:

Open a C++ IDE or text editor.

Write a simple program to print "Hello World" using the iostream library.

Compile and run the program to verify output.

Write a calculator program to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Declare variables with appropriate data types like int and float.

Take input values from the user using cin.

Use arithmetic operators to perform calculations.

Display results using cout.

Compile and run the calculator program to check correctness.

Conclusion: This experiment helped in understanding the basic syntax and structure of C++ programs. It provided hands-on experience with different data types and using input-output operations. Writing the "Hello World" and calculator programs reinforced knowledge of how to declare variables, use arithmetic operators, and perform simple computations, which forms the foundation of C++ programming.

EXPERIMENT 2
To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

Aim: The objective of this experiment is to study the overall structure of a C++ program and understand various data types such as int, float, char, and double. It focuses on declaring variables, initializing them, and displaying their values to understand how data types work in C++.

Procedure:

Create a new C++ program file.

Include the necessary header files and define the main() function.

Declare variables of different data types such as int, float, char, and double.

Initialize the variables with sample values.

Use the cout statement to display the values of the variables on the console.

Compile and run the program.

7)Observe the output and note the behavior of different data types.

Conclusion: Through this experiment, the user learned about various data types in C++ and how they are used to store different kinds of data. It also helped understand memory requirements and the importance of selecting the appropriate data type for variables in programs.

EXPERIMENT 3
To study and implement Operators in C++

Aim: The aim is to study and implement various operators in C++, including arithmetic, relational, and logical operators, to understand their usage and impact on data manipulation and decision making.

Procedure:

Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of arithmetic operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

Take two integer inputs from the user using cin.

Perform arithmetic operations and display the results using cout.

Implement relational operators such as equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).

Compare the input values using relational operators and display the boolean results.

Demonstrate the use of logical operators (&&, ||, !) in combining relational expressions.

Compile and run the program to verify all outputs.

Conclusion: This experiment provided a thorough understanding of how arithmetic, relational, and logical operators function in C++. It demonstrated the importance of these operators in performing calculations and making decisions based on conditions in a program.

EXPERIMENT 4
To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

Aim: The objective is to study and implement bitwise operators in C++ that operate on individual bits of integer data types to perform low-level data manipulation efficiently.

Procedure:

Write a program to accept two integer inputs from the user.

Demonstrate the use of bitwise AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>) operators.

Apply each bitwise operator on the input values.

Display the decimal results of each operation on the console.

Observe and analyze how bits of the numbers are affected by each operator.

Compile and run the program to check for correctness.

Conclusion: This experiment enhanced the understanding of bitwise operators and their applications in manipulating individual bits. It showed the significance of these operators in tasks like masking, toggling bits, and performing efficient computations at a low level.

EXPERIMENT 5
To study and implement C++ decision making statements

Aim: The aim is to study and implement various decision-making statements in C++ such as if, if-else, if-else-if, and switch-case. This helps control the flow of execution based on different conditions.

Procedure:

Write a program using a simple if statement to check a condition and execute a block of code.

Implement an if-else statement to handle two alternatives based on a condition.

Use an if-else-if ladder to manage multiple conditions in a sequence.

Write a program to demonstrate the switch-case statement for multiple choice decision making.

Take input from the user to evaluate different conditions.

Display corresponding messages based on the conditions.

Compile and run each program to verify logical correctness.

Conclusion: This experiment gave a comprehensive understanding of decision-making constructs in C++. It demonstrated how these statements can control the program flow based on conditions, enabling the development of logical and interactive applications.
